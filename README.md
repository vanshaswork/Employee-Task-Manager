# Employee Task Manager (Learning Project)

This is my first MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) project.  
I built it to practice:
- Creating APIs with Express
- Managing data with MongoDB + Mongoose
- Frontend with React
- Connecting frontend & backend

### Features (in progress)
- Assign tasks to employees
- Update task status (Not Started, In Progress, Completed)
- Track deadlines
- Mark completion before/after due date
- Search completed tasks

### Status
⚠️ Incomplete project – made while learning MERN.  
Now that I’ve learned the basics, I’m moving to **Next.js** for my next projects.

### Why this repo exists?
- To document my learning journey
- To keep track of my first ever MERN app
- To look back later and see how much I’ve grown 🚀
